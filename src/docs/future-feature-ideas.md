# Future Feature Ideas for Keydo

This document outlines specific and detailed next steps to provide the most value to users of the Keydo global shortcut management application.

## Immediate High-Value Features

### 1. Full Action Type Implementation

**Text Manipulation Actions:**
- Text snippets/templates insertion
- Text transformations (uppercase, lowercase, camelCase, snake_case)
- Text clipboard operations (copy predefined text, append to clipboard)
- Auto-typing for frequently used phrases

**File System Actions:**
- Quick file/folder opening
- File creation from templates
- Directory navigation shortcuts
- Bulk file operations (rename, move, delete)

**AI Integration Actions:**
- Quick AI prompts (summarize clipboard, improve writing, translate)
- Context-aware AI responses
- Integration with popular AI services (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)

### 2. Robust Action Execution System
Create a comprehensive action dispatcher in `src/electron/actions.ts`:

```typescript
// Example structure needed
export class ActionExecutor {
  static async executeAction(actionType: string, actionDetails: Record<string, any>) {
    switch(actionType) {
      case 'script': return await this.executeScript(actionDetails);
      case 'text': return await this.executeTextAction(actionDetails);
      case 'file': return await this.executeFileAction(actionDetails);
      case 'ai': return await this.executeAIAction(actionDetails);
    }
  }
}
```

## User Experience Enhancements

### 3. Shortcut Conflict Detection & Management
- Real-time conflict detection when creating shortcuts
- Visual indicators for conflicting shortcuts
- Automatic suggestions for alternative key combinations
- System shortcut awareness (avoid overriding OS shortcuts)

### 4. Better Shortcut Discovery & Organization
- Search and filter shortcuts by name, keys, or action type
- Categories/tags for grouping related shortcuts
- Import/export shortcut collections
- Quick access to recently used shortcuts
- Visual shortcut cheat sheets

### 5. Enhanced Configuration UI
- Drag-and-drop shortcut reordering
- Bulk edit operations
- One-click shortcut testing
- Visual shortcut key recorder (like OBS Studio's hotkey recorder)
- Context-sensitive help for each action type

## Advanced Functionality

### 6. Context-Aware Shortcuts
- Application-specific shortcuts (only active in certain apps)
- Window state conditions (fullscreen, minimized, etc.)
- Time-based activation (work hours only, etc.)
- File type context (shortcuts active only when certain file types are selected)

### 7. Shortcut Chains & Sequences
- Multi-step shortcuts (Ctrl+K, then T for "open terminal")
- Conditional logic in shortcuts
- Variable substitution (use selected text, current date, etc.)
- Macro recording and playback

### 8. Cloud Sync & Profiles
- User account system for syncing shortcuts across devices
- Team/organization shortcut sharing
- Profile switching (work profile vs personal profile)
- Backup and restore functionality

## Technical Infrastructure Improvements

### 9. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Ensure key mapping works correctly on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Platform-specific action adaptations
- Native OS integration (Windows: context menus, Mac: menu bar, Linux: system tray)

### 10. Performance & Reliability
- Lazy loading of shortcuts for faster startup
- Error handling and recovery for failed actions
- Logging system for debugging user issues
- Memory usage optimization for background operation

### 11. Security & Permissions
- Secure storage for sensitive action parameters (API keys, passwords)
- Permission system for potentially dangerous actions
- Sandboxed script execution
- User confirmation for destructive operations

## User Onboarding & Adoption

### 12. Getting Started Experience
- Interactive tutorial for first-time users
- Pre-built shortcut templates for common use cases
- Import from popular tools (AutoHotkey, Alfred, etc.)
- Sample shortcuts showcase

### 13. Documentation & Community
- Comprehensive user guide with examples
- Video tutorials for complex workflows
- Community shortcut sharing platform
- Plugin/extension system for developers

## Analytics & Feedback

### 14. Usage Analytics (Privacy-Focused)
- Local analytics to show user their most/least used shortcuts
- Performance metrics for action execution times
- Suggestions for optimization based on usage patterns

### 15. User Feedback System
- In-app feedback collection
- Feature request voting system
- Beta testing program for power users
