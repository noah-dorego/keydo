# Future Feature Ideas for Keydo

This document outlines specific and detailed next steps to provide the most value to users of the Keydo global shortcut management application.

## Immediate High-Value Features

### 1. Enhanced Action Type Implementation

**Text Manipulation Actions:**
- Text snippets/templates insertion
- Advanced text transformations (uppercase, lowercase, camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case, title case)
- Clipboard history management (store and cycle through recent clipboard items)
- Smart text actions (auto-complete common phrases, email signatures, code snippets)
- Text clipboard operations (copy predefined text, append to clipboard)
- Auto-typing for frequently used phrases

**File System Actions:**
- Quick file/folder opening
- File creation from templates (React component, Python class, etc.)
- Directory navigation shortcuts
- Bulk file operations (rename, move, delete)
- File organization by type (images, documents, etc.)

**AI Integration Actions:**
- Quick AI prompts (summarize clipboard, improve writing, translate)
- Context-aware AI responses
- Integration with popular AI services (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
- Smart suggestions based on usage patterns

### 2. Robust Action Execution System
Create a comprehensive action dispatcher in `src/electron/actions.ts`:

```typescript
// Example structure needed
export class ActionExecutor {
  static async executeAction(actionType: string, actionDetails: Record<string, any>) {
    switch(actionType) {
      case 'script': return await this.executeScript(actionDetails);
      case 'text': return await this.executeTextAction(actionDetails);
      case 'file': return await this.executeFileAction(actionDetails);
      case 'ai': return await this.executeAIAction(actionDetails);
    }
  }
}
```

## User Experience Enhancements

### 3. Shortcut Conflict Detection & Management
- Real-time conflict detection when creating shortcuts
- Visual indicators for conflicting shortcuts
- Automatic suggestions for alternative key combinations
- System shortcut awareness (avoid overriding OS shortcuts)
- Master pause switch (temporarily disable all shortcuts - great for gaming)

### 4. Enhanced Shortcut Discovery & Organization
- Search and filter shortcuts by name, keys, or action type
- Categories/tags for grouping related shortcuts (coding, writing, file management)
- Import/export shortcut collections
- Quick access to recently used shortcuts
- Visual shortcut cheat sheets
- Drag & drop reordering of shortcuts
- Bulk edit operations for multiple shortcuts

### 5. Advanced Configuration UI
- One-click shortcut testing
- Visual shortcut key recorder (like OBS Studio's hotkey recorder)
- Context-sensitive help for each action type
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Custom notification sounds (let users choose their own audio files)

## Advanced Functionality

### 6. Context-Aware Shortcuts
- Application-specific shortcuts (only active in certain apps like VS Code, Chrome, etc.)
- Window state conditions (fullscreen, minimized, focused app detection)
- Time-based activation (work hours only, specific days, etc.)
- File type context (shortcuts active only when certain file types are selected)

### 7. Shortcut Chains & Sequences
- Multi-step shortcuts (Ctrl+K, then T for "open terminal")
- Conditional logic in shortcuts
- Variable substitution (use selected text, current date, clipboard content in actions)
- Macro recording and playback
- Shortcut chains with conditional logic

### 8. Cloud Sync & Profiles
- User account system for syncing shortcuts across devices
- Team/organization shortcut sharing
- Profile switching (work profile vs personal profile)
- Backup and restore functionality
- Launch on startup with system boot

## Technical Infrastructure Improvements

### 9. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Ensure key mapping works correctly on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Platform-specific action adaptations
- Native OS integration:
  - Windows: Context menu integration
  - macOS: Menu bar integration
  - Linux: System tray integration
- Key mapping consistency across platforms

### 10. Performance & Reliability
- Lazy loading of shortcuts for faster startup
- Error handling and recovery for failed actions
- Logging system for debugging user issues
- Memory usage optimization for background operation
- Better error messages and recovery mechanisms

### 11. Security & Permissions
- Secure storage for sensitive action parameters (API keys, passwords)
- Permission system for potentially dangerous actions
- Sandboxed script execution
- User confirmation for destructive operations

## User Onboarding & Adoption

### 12. Getting Started Experience
- Interactive tutorial for first-time users
- Pre-built shortcut templates for common use cases
- Import from popular tools (AutoHotkey, Alfred, etc.)
- Sample shortcuts showcase
- Visual feedback and success indicators

### 13. Documentation & Community
- Comprehensive user guide with examples
- Video tutorials for complex workflows
- Community shortcut sharing platform
- Plugin/extension system for developers
- Shortcut marketplace for sharing and discovering useful shortcuts

## Analytics & Feedback

### 14. Usage Analytics (Privacy-Focused)
- Local analytics to show user their most/least used shortcuts
- Performance metrics for action execution times
- Suggestions for optimization based on usage patterns
- Usage tracking with privacy-focused, local-only storage

### 15. User Feedback System
- In-app feedback collection
- Feature request voting system
- Beta testing program for power users

## Quick Wins (Easy to Implement)

### 16. Immediate Improvements
- Theme toggle (dark/light mode switch)
- Launch on startup using Electron's `app.setLoginItemSettings()`
- Backup/restore functionality (simple JSON export/import)
- Master pause switch for all shortcuts
- Usage tracking for most used shortcuts
- Keyboard navigation support for power users
